    *fractum*

  Contains the atomic element of a particle of world-state.

  On the underscores, I was experimenting with the idea that
  these atomic elements can be constructed from the basic elements of
  higher category theory. I am going to deprioritize that, this is
  getting a bit too abstract for the scope of this project.
