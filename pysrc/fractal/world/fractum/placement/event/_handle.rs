"""
    Handlers

Namespace for the callback functions that are used during training.
This enables logging, saving and plotting to be implemented separately.
An example handler object is `Session`.

All callback functions take a handler object `h` as their first argument
and sometimes a second argment `r` that consists in a report.

| `training_finished(h)`      | called once at the end of training             |
