A generic, standalone implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search.
It can be used on any game that implements `GameInterface`
and with any external oracle.

## Oracle Interface

An oracle can be any function or callable object.
  
   oracle(state)

evaluates a single state from the current player's perspective and returns 
a pair `(P, V)` where:

  - `P` is a probability vector on `GI.available_actions(GI.init(gspec, state))`
  - `V` is a scalar estimating the value or win probability for white.

\\\!
    MCTS.RolloutOracle(game_spec::AbstractGameSpec, γ=1.) <: Function

This oracle estimates the value of a position by simulating a random game
from it (a rollout). Moreover, it puts a uniform prior on available actions.
Therefore, it can be used to implement the "vanilla" MCTS algorithm.

  r = 0.
  while !GI.game_terminated(game)
    action = rand(GI.available_actions(game))
    GI.play!(game, action)
    r = γ * r + GI.white_reward(game)
  end
  return r
end

function (r::RolloutOracle)(state)
  g = GI.init(r.gspec, state)
  wp = GI.white_playing(g)
  n = length(GI.available_actions(g))
  P = ones(n) ./ n
  wr = rollout!(g, r.gamma)
  V = wp ? wr : -wr
  return P, V

# Explanation

An MCTS player picks an action as follows. Given a game state, it launches
`num_iters_per_turn` MCTS iterations, with UCT exploration constant `cpuct`.
Rewards are discounted using the `gamma` factor.

Then, an action is picked according to the distribution ``π`` where
``π_i ∝ n_i^{1/τ}`` with ``n_i`` the number of times that the ``i^{\\text{th}}``
action was visited and ``τ`` the `temperature` parameter.

It is typical to use a high value of the temperature parameter ``τ``
during the first moves of a game to increase exploration and then switch to
a small value. Therefore, `temperature` is am <`AbstractSchedule`>(@ref).

For information on parameters `cpuct`, `dirichlet_noise_ϵ`,
`dirichlet_noise_α` and `prior_temperature`, see <`MCTS.Env`>(@ref).

# AlphaGo Zero Parameters

In the original AlphaGo Zero paper:

+ The discount factor `gamma` is set to 1.
+ The number of MCTS iterations per move is 1600, which
  corresponds to 0.4s of computation time.
+ The temperature is set to 1 for the 30 first moves and then to an
  infinitesimal value.
+ The ``ϵ`` parameter for the Dirichlet noise is set to ``0.25`` and
  the ``α`` parameter to ``0.03``, which is consistent with the heuristic
  of using ``α = 10/n`` with ``n`` the maximum number of possibles moves,
  which is ``19 × 19 + 1 = 362`` in the case of Go.

    SamplesWeighingPolicy

During &self-play, early board positions are possibly encountered many
times across several games. The corresponding samples can be merged
together and given a weight ``W`` that is a nondecreasing function of the
number ``n`` of merged samples:

  - `CONSTANT_WEIGHT`: ``W(n) = 1``
  - `LOG_WEIGHT`: ``W(n) = \\log_2(n) + 1``
  - `LINEAR_WEIGHT`: ``W(n) = n``
