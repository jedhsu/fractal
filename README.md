## Fractum

Fractum is a developing spec for a reinforcement learning library. It is written with
a creative flavor of computational trinitarianism based on some deeper intuitions.

### Fractum

An environment state is a *fractum* - it holds the data of a quantum (discrete quantity) and a probability distribution (spectrum)
on its near-future placement (its position in some spacetime).

### TODO
* Read quantum mechanics to see if rigorously compares.

## World

This suggests a framing that the  


### Grammatical Tense

Grammatical tense is used to indicate a particular semantics of an object.

* Operation is a concept. It which might hold parameters.
* Operator is a type.
* Operating is a function.
* Operate is an async function that returns an await, as asynchronous functions abstract time from computation.
* Operated is a value instantiated by the type Operator.

## Mind


To describe networks being trained, the world *evolves*, and the mind *realizes* this evolution.
