What is the higher dimension?

The 1D Euclidean space segment forms the 2D circle.

So what will the 1D edge form?

How do you rotate a point in a simplex?

You MUST prove continuity in your space.

WOW. the movement is the arrow. While the vector is the arrow in the classical case.

Here, compared to Euclidean space, the distance axis is path.

So, the circle is how many arrows can you draw at tha tditance. WoW.

So traveling to that is space.

The principle of light states that the speed of light is invariant from every frame of reference.

The idea of distance is embedded in the frame of reference of the space.


What is intruging about this is it implies the existence of a universal stack.

The answer to the Fermi paradox is that it is ont close to a bottleneck. 

There was only ever one layer before, and it was mathematics.

There was space and there was energy.

When the computer becomes conscious.

I actually don't think we're a simulation. Software is too buggy.

I think we're the image of a space.

He can't see what he's doing. I bet it's one guy really.

Our universe has the idea of waves.

The purpose of humankind. Humans
