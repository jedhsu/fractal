  The neural network goes through `num_checkpoints` series of `n` updates using
  batches of size `batch_size` drawn from memory, where `n` is fnined as follows:

```
n = min(max_batches_per_checkpoint, ntotal ÷ min_checkpoints_per_epoch)
```

with `ntotal` the total number of batches in memory. Between each series,
the current network is evaluated against the best network so far
(see [`ArenaParams`](@ref)).

In the original AlphaGo Zero paper:
+ The batch size for gradient updates is ``2048``.

+ The L2 regularization parameter is set to ``10^{-4}``.

+ Checkpoints are produced every 1000 training steps, which corresponds
  to seeing about 20% of the samples in the memory buffer:
  ``(1000 × 2048) / 10^7  ≈ 0.2``.

  + It is unclear how many checkpoints are taken or how many training steps
  are performed in total.
